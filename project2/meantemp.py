def avg_weekend_temperature(filename):
    '''
    This function should run a SQL query on a dataframe of
    weather data.  The SQL query should return one column and
    one row - the average meantempi on days that are a Saturday
    or Sunday (i.e., the the average mean temperature on weekends).
    The dataframe will be titled 'weather_data' and you can access
    the date in the dataframe via the 'date' column.
    
    Also, you can convert dates to days of the week via the 'strftime' keyword in SQL.
    For example, cast (strftime('%w', date) as integer) will return 0 if the date
    is a Sunday or 6 if the date is a Saturday.
    
    You can see the weather data that we are passing in below:
